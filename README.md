# BasketMarketAnalysis
In this project, I conducted a Market Basket Analysis using R and various data manipulation and visualization tools, such as ggplot2 and arules. The analysis uncovered key associations between items frequently bought together, providing valuable insights for inventory management and marketing strategies. 

This project utilizes the ["Online Retail" dataset](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Farchive.ics.uci.edu%2Fdataset%2F352%2Fonline%2Bretail) from the [UCI Machine Learning repository](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Farchive.ics.uci.edu%2F), containing transactions from a UK-based online retailer between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011. The retailer specializes in unique all-occasion gifts, with many customers being wholesalers.
